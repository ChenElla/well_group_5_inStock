# InStock - Inventory Management System
Welcome to the InStock Inventory Management System project! This collaborative effort is dedicated to delivering a robust, full-stack React application tailored for a Fortune 500 client. The overarching objective is to transform the existing non-scalable system into a modern and efficient solution, seamlessly integrating a React front-end with a powerful Express back-end.

## Project Overview
In this project, we operated as an Agile team of 4, emulating a real-world environment within a modern tech company. Our primary focus was on effectively managing intricate tasks and meeting deadlines for this time-critical application. The project, aptly named 'InStock', involves the creation of a web application from scratch. We utilized JIRA to manage our project progress and smoothen the integration phase in the final step.

## Tools and Technologies
We harnessed the following tools and technologies to achieve the project's objectives:

Front-end Development:

* React
* Vite
* react-router-dom
* BEM/SASS for styling
* Back-end Development:

* Node.js
* Express
* MySQL
* knex

Additional Tools:

* npm for package management
* Postman for API testing
